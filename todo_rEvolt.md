  is the oldest system on The Mana World? Including, it is featured on the very first commit of tmwa-server-data.
  We're speaking of a thing which existed since 2005, so I'm not sure if throwing it away is a good idea. ~ Jesusalva, 21/04/20

* [ ] Decide on Karma (and / or Legion vs. Brotherhood "Points"?)

* Karma system by itself we can't use (it cause PvP bugs). ~ Jesusalva, 21/04/20
* We also had a few other guilds, right? IIRC, Legion based in Esperia, Brotherhood based in Hurnscald, and Mage Guild
  based in Tulimshar. (And if I understood correctly, those stands for: Warrior, Ranger, and Mage class specializations) ~ Jesusalva, 21/04/20

* [ ] Add gem powder for dyeable metal gear?

* Currently, the code is bypassing the Flyer part. I'm kinda happy with it. (Not really happy, but it can work for now with some polishing) ~ Jesusalva, 21/04/20
* [ ] This still using rowboat code, what will we use exactly? (I'm too much of a layman to find weak spots on rowboat. Could use diagonal movement.) ~ Jesusalva, 21/04/20
    * afaik adding diagonal movent requires to much new sprites (all clothes need to be added i believe) plan is to replace rowboat code with a cutscene involving the rowboat. boat will only move east.  I'll try to come up with some stuff after i finished kfahr ~ Toams 21/04/20
