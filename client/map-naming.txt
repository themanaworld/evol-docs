Following concept applies for map naming on rEvolt:

FIRST PART: Three digits. Continents / regions will have a three-digit number; main regions will have multiples of 4, side regions will have numbers next to the aligned main region. 

SECOND PART: One digit. Outside maps will have a 1, indoor maps will have a 2, caves and dungeons will have a 3.

THIRD PART: One or Two digits. Unique numbering for every corresponding main / side region.
